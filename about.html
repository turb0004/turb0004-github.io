   <h2>A bit About Me...</h2>
    <p><img src="images/portrait.jpg" class="portrait" alt="Chelsea Turbide."> Hi! If you haven't noticed yet, my name is Chelsea Turbide. Putting a face to the name. I am currently a student attending Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design Program. I have many hobbies which I enjoy that routed me down to pursue this industry in the media developing world. I love to learn in order to extend my knowledge on multiple interesting topics, leading me to be intrigued by what this course had to offer. As a result of being a part of this class, I decided my best option was to showcase my recent work in relation to what I have been educated on. Through this program at Algonquin, I have accomplished so much that I would have never tried in the first place, and for that, I am proud.</p>
